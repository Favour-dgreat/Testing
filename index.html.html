   <h1>HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language</h1> 
   <p>HTML is used for the basic structure of the website. The text, list items, tables, images,etc.</p>
   <p>HTML is sometimes also refferred to as the skeleton of a website. Because it provides the bare content of the website, without any design or functionalities.
       <br>Over the years we have had so many versions of HTML, which includes:
       <ul>
           <li>
               HTML 3
           </li>
           <li>
               HTML:XML
           </li>
           <li>
               HTML:5
           </li>
       </ul>
       <p>Note: HTML:5 is the most current version of HTML, though we expect HTML:6 to be released this year.</p>

       <p>So the basic HTML Structure includes the Head and the Body.(Most people add the footer to this list but its not really proper, because the footer is supposedly part of what should be in between the body tags.)</p>
   </p>
   <h2>Head</h2>
   <p>The Head section of a HTML file should contain the following:
       <ul>
           <li>The Title - This displays the title of the webpage. </li>
           <li>meta Charset - This defines the current encoding that should be used in the website. And currently now it is UTF-8</li>
            <li>meta name - This is used for the responsiveness of the website, and it is usually in this format: meta name ="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"</li>
        </ul>
   </p>
   
   <h2>Body</h2>
   <p>The Body section of a HTML file is used to display the contents that should be displayed on the browser.
     <br>NOTE: Everything in between the body tag is what should be displayed on the website.   
   </p>

   <h2>Tags</h2>
   <p>So tags in HTML are special names </p>
